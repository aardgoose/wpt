<title>Tests the SMS Receiver API</title>

<!--
 sms_provider.js is a testing framework that enables engines to test the sms
 receiver API by intercepting the connection between the browser and the
 underlying operating system and mock its behavior.

 Usage:

 1) Include <script src="./sms_provider.js"></script> in your test.
 2) Set expectations
  expect(getNextMessage).andReturn((threshold) => {
     // mock behavior
   })
 3) Replay expectations
   await replay();
 4) Call new SMSReceiver().start();
 5) Verify results

 The mocking API is browser agnostic and is designed such that other engines
 could implement it too.

 Here are the symbols that are exposed to tests that need to be implemented
 per engine:

 - function getNextMessage(): the main/only function that can be mocked.
 - function expect(): the main/only function that enables us to mock it.
 - function replay(): replays all of the expectations before exercising them.
 - enum State {kSuccess, kTimeout}: allows you to mock success/failures.

promise_test(async t => {
  expect(getNextMessage).andReturn((threshold) => {
      return Promise.resolve({
        sms: {
          content: "hello",
          status: Status.kSuccess,
        }
      });
  });

  let receiver = new SMSReceiver();

  let watcher = new EventWatcher(t, receiver, ["change"]);

  await replay();

  await receiver.start();

  // Waits for the first event.
  await watcher.wait_for("change");

  assert_equals(receiver.sms.content, "hello");
}, 'Basic usage');

promise_test(async t => {
  expect(getNextMessage).andReturn((threshold) => {
      return Promise.resolve({
        sms: {
          content: "",
          status: Status.kTimeout,
        }
      });
  });

  let receiver = new SMSReceiver();

  let watcher = new EventWatcher(t, receiver, ["timeout"]);

  await replay();

  await receiver.start();

  // Waits for the first event.
  await watcher.wait_for("timeout");
}, 'Deal with timeouts');
